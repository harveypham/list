# list
Implementation of doubly-linked list.

The purpose of this excercise is focus:
1) Practice set up Dev Container of VS Code
2) Writing simple unit test using assert (see test.cpp) for cases when you don't want to include testing framework
3) Writing unit test using GTest (see gtest.cpp)
4) Use test cases as document the behavior of the target code

# Environment:
While the code uses standard C++, it is tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 docker container with gcc. (See .devcontainer/Dockerfile for the specification of docker image)

It is best to use Dev Container feature on VS Code to let the IDE starts the container and mount the source code. VS Code settings are included with this project.
