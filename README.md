# list
Implementation of doubly-linked list

# Environment:
While the code uses standard C++, it is tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 docker container with gcc. (See .devcontainer/Dockerfile for the specification of docker image)

It is best to use Dev Container feature on VS Code to let the IDE starts the container and mount the source code. VS Code settings are included with this project.
